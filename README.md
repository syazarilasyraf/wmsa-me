# wmsa-me

An online platform for sharing insightful notes on a variety of topics. These notes are organized into categories such as Learning, Efficiency, Tech, Self, Society, Creativity, and Location.

## About

WMSA stands for the acronym of my full name. It's built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the "No Style, Please" theme by [riggraz](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please).

## Features

One unique feature of this platform is the ability to post notes directly from the Obsidian.

I explained how i do this on this [post](https://syazarilasyraf.com/personalizing-your-website).

## Usage

No special setup is required as the platform is based on the "No Style, Please" theme. You can simply start posting your valuable notes.

## Future Plans

Currently, the focus is on posting new notes whenever time allows.

Visit [wmsa.me](https://wmsa.me) to explore and share these insightful notes.

Feel free to contribute or reach out to me for more information.
