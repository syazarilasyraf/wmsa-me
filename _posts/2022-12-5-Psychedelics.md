Psychedelics create a "counter culture" in the mind. People who do psychedelics or have experienced them, tend to "break free" from the false reality or veil that has placed over our eyes. 

The "Drink your milk, eat your meat and join the navy" propaganda tends to get erased from the minds of those who experienced a psychedelic experience. 

The "Go to college, get a job, buy a large home or get married and have lots and lots of kids." Etc now is seen as a mechanism to enslave and entrapped your human existence for capital gain and political power.
