What is your definition of retirement? 

Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you're retired.

How do you get there? 

Well, one way is to have so much money saved that your passive income (without you lifting a finger) covers your burn rate. 

A second is you just drive your burn rate down to zero you become a monk. 

A third is you're doing something you love. You enjoy it so much, it's not about the money. So there are multiple ways to retirement.
